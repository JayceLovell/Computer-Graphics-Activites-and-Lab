## Controls
Movement AWSD
1 to toggle lava  
2 to toggle bloom on plastic rings
## Shaders  
### Lava  
Used simple height wave shader and changed the texture but coded a script so when toggle it changes the height.  

### Wallpaper
Used  Bump shader to implement.  

### Plastic Rings
Used Bloom shader for this and just like the wave wrote code to adjust values.

### Rim
Tried to implement rim shader as bonus but couldn't find solution on how to implement it on 2d Object.  

Can't really do anymore....idk what modifications I can do...sigh.
